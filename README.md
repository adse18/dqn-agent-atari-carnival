# dqn-agent-atari-carnival
Reinforcement learning of a DQN-agent in OpenAIÂ´s gymnasium environment "Atari Carnival"

The core of the repository is the jupyter notebook, the full notebook with all versions can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/code/skillinho/rl-project/notebook

Due to the fact that video rendering did not work in the kaggle notebook, a local installation was run in an anaconda environment with the weigths outputted by the notebook in kaggle. An example video is in the video folder.

The other files can be used to set up an anaconda environment and create the video locally. There it is important to check for the python version as for 3.12 there appeared to be problems with handling gym environments.
