# DQN Agent for Atari Carnival

Reinforcement learning with a DQN agent in OpenAI's Gymnasium environment "Atari Carnival".

## Core Repository

The core of the repository is the Jupyter Notebook. The full notebook with all versions and the development steps can be found at [Kaggle: RL Project Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/skillinho/rl-project/notebook).

## Video Rendering

Due to issues with video rendering in the Kaggle notebook, a local installation was run in an Anaconda environment using the weights outputted by the notebook on Kaggle. An example video of the agentÂ´s performance in the environment is available in the `video` folder.

## Local Setup

The other files in this repository can be used to set up an Anaconda environment and create the video locally. 

**Important**: Check for the Python version, as there appeared to be problems handling Gym environments with Python 3.12.
